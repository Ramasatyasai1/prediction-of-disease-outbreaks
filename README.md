Project Overview

This project aims to predict COVID-19 case trends using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression. It analyzes time-series data of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries to estimate future trends and provide insights for healthcare and policy planning.

Steps to Run the Project

1. Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

To install the required libraries, use the command:
. Dataset Collection

Download the COVID-19 time-series dataset from the WHO or John Hopkins University.

Ensure the dataset contains confirmed, death, and recovered cases for various regions.

Place the dataset in the data/ directory.

3. Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset using Pandas.

Handle missing values and normalize the data.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
 Model Training

Implement Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression for prediction.

Train the model on historical COVID-19 case data.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and accuracy score.
Visualization

Generate graphs comparing actual vs predicted cases.
Future Enhancements

Implement deep learning models (LSTMs) for better predictions.

Integrate real-time data updates.

Improve model accuracy with feature engineering.
